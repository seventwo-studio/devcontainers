## Bill of Materials

### Base Components
- All components from the base image
- GitHub Actions runner (latest version)
- Docker CLI (v27.1.1)
- Docker Buildx plugin (v0.16.2)
- Runner container hooks (v0.7.0)
- Node.js (v20 LTS)
- Playwright (latest version)

### Playwright Browsers
- Chromium (latest stable)
- Firefox (latest stable)
- WebKit (latest stable)
- Microsoft Edge (latest stable)

### System Users
- `runner` user (UID 1001) with sudo access
- `docker` group (GID 123) for Docker access

### Environment Variables
- `RUNNER_MANUALLY_TRAP_SIG=1` - Manual signal trapping
- `ACTIONS_RUNNER_PRINT_LOG_TO_STDOUT=1` - Log output to stdout
- `ImageOS=ubuntu22` - OS identification for Actions
- `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/root/.cache/ms-playwright` - Browser cache location (system browsers)
- `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1` - Skip downloads during npm install (use system browsers)

## Usage

### Building the Image

```bash
# Build for current platform
docker build -t runner:latest .

# Build for specific platform
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t runner:amd64 .
docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t runner:arm64 .

# Multi-platform build
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t runner:latest .

# Optimized build with layer caching (recommended for CI)
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  --cache-from type=registry,ref=ghcr.io/seventwo-studio/runner:buildcache \
  --cache-to type=registry,ref=ghcr.io/seventwo-studio/runner:buildcache,mode=max \
  -t runner:latest \
  .

# Build with custom Playwright version
docker build --build-arg PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION=1.45.0 -t runner:latest .
```

**Build Optimization Notes:**
- The Dockerfile uses multi-stage builds to separate Playwright installation for optimal caching
- BuildKit mount caches are used for apt packages to speed up dependency installation
- Playwright browsers are installed in a dedicated stage that caches independently
- Node.js and browser binaries are copied from the playwright stage to the final image
- Use `--cache-from` and `--cache-to` flags in CI for persistent layer caching

### Running as Self-Hosted Runner

## GitHub Actions Workflow Examples

### Basic CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '20'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
    
    - name: Build application
      run: npm run build

  docker-build:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    needs: test
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Build Docker image
      run: docker build -t myapp:latest .
    
    - name: Run container tests
      run: docker run --rm myapp:latest npm test
```

### Multi-Platform Build

```yaml
name: Multi-Platform Build

on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*']

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
    
    - name: Build and push multi-platform image
      run: |
        docker buildx build \
          --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
          --push \
          -t myregistry/myapp:${{ github.ref_name }} \
          .
```

### Playwright End-to-End Testing

The runner image includes pre-installed Playwright browsers, eliminating the need to download them during workflow runs. This significantly speeds up test execution.

#### Basic E2E Test Workflow

```yaml
name: E2E Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  playwright-tests:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
      # Note: Browsers are NOT downloaded during npm ci
      # PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1 is set by default
      # This makes npm ci much faster (no 500MB+ download)

    - name: Run Playwright tests (Chromium)
      run: npx playwright test --project=chromium

    - name: Run Playwright tests (Firefox)
      run: npx playwright test --project=firefox

    - name: Run Playwright tests (WebKit)
      run: npx playwright test --project=webkit

    - name: Upload test results
      if: always()
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: playwright-report
        path: playwright-report/
```

#### Parallel Multi-Browser Testing

```yaml
name: E2E Tests (Parallel)

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  playwright-tests:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        browser: [chromium, firefox, webkit, msedge]
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Install dependencies (fast - no browser download)
      run: npm ci

    - name: Run Playwright tests on ${{ matrix.browser }}
      run: npx playwright test --project=${{ matrix.browser }}

    - name: Upload test results
      if: always()
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: playwright-report-${{ matrix.browser }}
        path: playwright-report/
```

#### Installation Time Comparison

| Step | With Pre-installed Browsers | Without Pre-installed Browsers |
|------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `npm ci` | ~30 seconds | ~3-5 minutes |
| Browser download | **0 seconds (skipped)** | ~2-4 minutes |
| System deps install | **0 seconds (pre-installed)** | ~1-2 minutes |
| **Total setup time** | **~30 seconds** | **~6-11 minutes** |

**Key Optimization Details:**

1. **No Browser Downloads**: `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1` is set globally
   - When you run `npm ci`, Playwright detects this environment variable
   - It skips downloading ~500MB+ of browser binaries
   - Installation completes in seconds instead of minutes

2. **System Browsers Used**: `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/root/.cache/ms-playwright`
   - Your project's Playwright automatically finds the pre-installed browsers
   - All browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Edge) are available immediately
   - Works with any Playwright version (browsers are version-compatible)

3. **Fast Iteration**:
   - Re-running tests after code changes takes seconds
   - No waiting for downloads or dependency installation
   - Perfect for rapid test development

**Important Notes:**
- For Chromium-based browsers, ensure you run the container with `--ipc=host` flag to avoid out-of-memory issues
- Browsers run in headless mode by default - perfect for CI/CD
- All system dependencies are pre-installed, ensuring fast test startup
- Works with both `@playwright/test` and `playwright` npm packages

**Docker run example with Playwright:**
```bash
docker run -it --ipc=host \
  -e GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token \
  -e REPO_URL=https://github.com/owner/repo \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  runner:latest
```

## Security Considerations

### Sandbox Configuration

The runner supports the same security sandbox as the base image:

```bash
# Enable sandbox with specific domains
docker run -it \
  --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
  -e SANDBOX_ENABLED=true \
  -e SANDBOX_ALLOWED_DOMAINS="api.github.com,github.com,registry.npmjs.org" \
  runner:latest
```

### Best Practices

1. **Use Secrets**: Store sensitive information in GitHub Secrets
2. **Enable Sandbox**: Use security sandbox for untrusted code
3. **Limit Network Access**: Configure allowed domains appropriately
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep runner image updated
5. **Monitor Resources**: Set resource limits in production

## Troubleshooting

### Runner Registration Issues

1. **Invalid Token**
   ```bash
   # Check token validity
   curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
     https://api.github.com/user
   ```

2. **Repository Access**
   ```bash
   # Verify repository access
   curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
     https://api.github.com/repos/owner/repo
   ```

### Docker Issues

1. **Docker Socket Permission**
   ```bash
   # Fix docker socket permissions
   sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
   ```

2. **Docker Daemon Not Running**
   ```bash
   # Start Docker daemon
   sudo systemctl start docker
   ```

### Sandbox Issues

1. **Network Connectivity**
   ```bash
   # Check firewall rules
   sudo iptables -L OUTPUT -n
   
   # Test connectivity
   curl -v https://api.github.com
   ```

2. **Missing Capabilities**
   ```bash
   # Check capabilities
   capsh --print | grep NET_ADMIN
   ```

### Performance Issues

1. **Resource Limits**
   ```bash
   # Monitor resource usage
   docker stats
   ```

2. **Disk Space**
   ```bash
   # Clean up Docker images
   docker system prune -a
   ```

### Playwright Issues

1. **Chromium Out-of-Memory Errors**
   ```bash
   # Ensure container is running with --ipc=host
   docker run -it --ipc=host runner:latest

   # Or in docker-compose.yml
   ipc: host
   ```

2. **Browser Not Found After npm ci**
   ```bash
   # Check if environment variables are set correctly
   echo $PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH
   # Should output: /root/.cache/ms-playwright

   echo $PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD
   # Should output: 1

   # Verify system browsers exist
   ls -la /root/.cache/ms-playwright

   # Test browser availability
   npx playwright install --dry-run
   ```

3. **Accidentally Downloaded Browsers During npm ci**
   ```bash
   # If you see Playwright downloading browsers, check:
   # 1. Environment variable is set
   env | grep PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD

   # 2. If running in a different user context, set it explicitly
   export PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1
   npm ci
   ```

4. **Version Mismatch Warnings**
   ```bash
   # System browsers work with any Playwright version
   # If you see version warnings, they're usually safe to ignore
   # But you can force using system browsers:
   PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/root/.cache/ms-playwright npx playwright test
   ```

5. **Test Timeouts**
   ```bash
   # Increase timeout in playwright.config.js
   # timeout: 30000 (default) -> 60000

   # Or set via environment variable
   PLAYWRIGHT_TIMEOUT=60000 npx playwright test
   ```

6. **Display Issues in Headless Mode**
   ```bash
   # Xvfb is pre-installed for virtual display support
   # Tests should run headless by default
   xvfb-run npx playwright test

   # Or explicitly set headless in playwright.config.js
   use: { headless: true }
   ```

7. **Permission Denied on Browser Binaries**
   ```bash
   # Check browser cache permissions
   ls -la /root/.cache/ms-playwright

   # Fix permissions if needed
   sudo chmod -R 755 /root/.cache/ms-playwright
   ```

8. **Want to Use Project-Specific Browsers**
   ```bash
   # Temporarily allow browser downloads for this run
   PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=0 npm ci

   # Or unset the variable
   unset PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD
   npm ci
   npx playwright install --with-deps

   # Note: This will download ~500MB and take several minutes
   ```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Runner Scripts

```bash
# Create custom runner configuration
cat > runner-config.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
./config.sh \
  --url "$REPO_URL" \
  --token "$GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  --name "$RUNNER_NAME" \
  --labels "$RUNNER_LABELS" \
  --unattended \
  --replace

./run.sh
EOF

chmod +x runner-config.sh
```

### Health Checks

```yaml
# Docker Compose with health check
version: '3.8'

services:
  github-runner:
    image: ghcr.io/seventwo-studio/runner:latest
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "pgrep", "-f", "Runner.Listener"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 60s
```

### Monitoring

```bash
# Check runner status
docker exec runner-container ps aux | grep Runner.Listener

# View runner logs
docker logs runner-container

# Monitor resource usage
docker stats runner-container
```
